## Overview

### The challenge

- Obtain an advice  and its ID by clicking on the dice button
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS pre-processor
- SASS partials
- Flexbox
- API implementation (Advice Slip JSON API)
- JavaScript modules


### What I learned

<div style='padding: 20px'>
  It was a very interesting challenge to practice API uses with Javascript with async functions. I tried using React.JS on it, but it's such a small project that it turns out React was becoming an overkill tool.
  <br><br>
  For the first time I had the opportunity to use the value "fit-content" for height properties, the best solution to layouts where the size of containers should adapt the content size.
</div>

### Continued development

I feel compeled to try implementing a translation API and make this app available in my language (portuguese). I'm also looking forward to add a "Light mode" button.
