## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Icons inserted with pseudo-elements
- Position
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge gave me the opportunity to practice position properties, mixed with flexbox to organize items inside containers. 

I also learned the shorthand property "overflow", which we can use to make elements overlap its container by setting the value "visible". It was used to make the smartphone and premium section to overlap the background div.

Making the responsive versions of the desktop layout was kinda...annoying. I'm used to use flexbox and grid layouts that helps a lot with responsive designs. Using positions, a lot more have to be done to set the elements the way they're supposed to be.
