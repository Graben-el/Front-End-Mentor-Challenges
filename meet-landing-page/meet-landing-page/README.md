## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was supposed to be another easy challenge to practice landing page creation skills with basic html and css. Got surprise having difficulties to develop the responsive layout, probably because I did stop practicing for a while for personal reasons.

Still it was very interesting to practice it again and regain my normal abilities.
