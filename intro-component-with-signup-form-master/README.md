## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS pre-processor
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

This is my first challenge from front-end mentor using javascript. It was fun, I was finally able to test my JS skills.

It also is my first project using my SASS/SCSS skills after finishing the SASS course. It really helps to improve your productivity and make it easier to set the properties in the right spot.
